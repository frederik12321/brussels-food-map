It's like being in a movie, watching the chefs in action. The service is also impeccable: the team is warm, smiling, and always attentive.\n\nUnfortunately, out of about twenty dishes served, we encountered three major errors that, in an establishment of this caliber, are difficult to accept:\n\nA squid ink risotto so salty that we couldn't finish it.\n\nA perfectly cooked piece of meat that was sorely lacking in salt (an error that was apparently corrected in the next course).\nThe most shocking: a rotten cherry served for dessert.\n\nWhat disappointed us most was the attitude toward these problems. When we reported the rotten cherry, we received only a simple \"sorry.\" No apology from the chef, even though he was present 50 cm from our table when we left. I also took the time to send a detailed review by email following their request, without receiving the slightest response.\n\nIn conclusion, fifteen of the eighteen dishes were probably delicious, but when you have such ambitions, three mistakes, including a rotten piece of fruit, are inexcusable. The team's total lack of consideration and apologies turns a culinary disappointment into a real frustration.\nA shame for an establishment that has everything it takes to excel but seems to forget the importance of after-sales service and acknowledging its mistakes.",

The food itself was exceptional, beautifully presented, full of flavor, and clearly crafted with care and creativity. Each course was a delight and flowed seamlessly into the next.\n\nWhat made my evening especially memorable, though, was the attention to detail in the hospitality. I was dining alone, and in between courses the staff offered me a book to enjoy. They even selected one in English, my native language, which was such a considerate and unexpected touch. It turned what could have been a quiet gap into a genuinely enjoyable and warm moment, making me feel completely at ease.\n\nElaine strikes a perfect balance between refined dining and genuine hospitality. The atmosphere is intimate and welcoming, the service attentive without ever being overbearing, and the small touches truly elevate the entire experience. I left not only satisfied with an excellent meal but also feeling cared for in a way that is rare to find.\n\nI will most certainly return the next time I am in Brussels, and I would encourage anyone looking for a memorable dining experience to do the same.",

The playlist, the space, the way the staff moved—everything was sensuous and intentional. Looking back, maybe I was just intoxicated by the place, the people, the time.\n\nI still remember the gay couple next to us, licking every bit of the venison sauce off their plates with their fingers. It was that relaxed—unpretentious yet elegant, effortlessly stylish. The restaurant eventually closed around the time of the pandemic, but the tender warmth of that experience lingered long after. I kept following Chef Kobe Desramaults’ journey, from hotels and pop-ups to finally opening Eliane in Brussels. The catch? It’s closed on Saturdays, Sundays, and Mondays—making it a real challenge to schedule a visit.\n\nMichelin stars, World’s 50 Best—none of that really matters to me. He’s the kind of chef who awakens your senses. He’s simply faithful to his own sensory world and creative universe, and the results naturally follow. It’s not about striving or chasing prestige—it’s about expressing one’s way of being. Maybe that’s what mastery is: the delicate craftsmanship of making the natural feel inevitable. The quiet elegance of an artist.\n\nEven the butter served with bread had a texture and aroma that stood out. I asked about it—and of course, it was made in-house with cream from cows raised on an organic farm, fed only fresh herbs and grass. Cultured and churned by hand.\n\nOf course. Any house with soul knows that even the condiments deserve intention. There are no throwaways.",

The only tiny downside: the music was sometimes too loud, but I'm convinced that was due to poor handling (this wasn't the case at all throughout the lunch, only a small part).",
