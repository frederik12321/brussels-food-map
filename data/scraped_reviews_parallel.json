Honestly, we loved it from start to finish.\n\nYou can immediately tell that everything is homemade, from the spit-roasted meat to the falafels and even the fries. It really makes all the difference, and you can taste it from the very first bite. The ingredients are delicious, fresh, and prepared with great care.\n\nA huge plus is the service: the team is super friendly, welcoming, and makes you feel right at home. It's a great place to be, and it makes the experience even better.\n\nDefinitely a place we highly recommend if you're looking for a quality kebab. We'll definitely be back!",
